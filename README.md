Networking Fundamentals
Protocols
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data.
UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Allows fast transmission without ensuring data reliability. Used for video streaming, gaming, etc.
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Facilitates client-server communication for web requests.
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): Used for sending emails.
POP3 & IMAP: Protocols used for receiving emails.
Networking Basics
Data Delivery: Data is delivered in packets or chunks across networks.
IP Address: Represented as x.x.x.x (0-255), used to identify devices on a network.
Port Number: Identifies specific applications on devices. Ranges: Reserved ports (0-1023), application ports (1024-49152), and others.
Bandwidth: Mbps, Kbps, Gbps represent data transmission rates.
Network Types
LAN (Local Area Network): Small-scale networks like homes or offices usually connected via Wi-Fi.
MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): Covers a city or metropolitan area.
WAN (Wide Area Network): Spans across countries using optical fiber cables, utilizing technologies like SONET and Frame Relay.
Network Topologies
Bus: All devices connected to a single line.
Ring: Devices connected in a circular manner.
Star: Devices connected to a central hub or switch.
Tree: Combination of Bus and Star topologies.
Mesh: Every computer is interconnected.
OSI Model Layers
Application Layer: Software that sends and receives messages.
Presentation Layer: Handles encryption, decryption, and data translation.
Session Layer: Manages connections, segments data with sequence numbers.
Transport Layer: Ensures error control, reliable data transport.
Network Layer: Communication between computers, routing, logical addressing.
Data Link Layer: Direct communication with sender and receiver, uses IP addresses.
Physical Layer: Transmits raw bit streams over physical media.
TCP/IP Model Layers
Application Layer: Deals with user interactions and protocols like web browsers.
Transport Layer: Manages protocols for data transport.
Network Layer: Concerned with client communication.
Data Layer: Not explicitly defined.
Physical Layer: Handles physical data transmission.
